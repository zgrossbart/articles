Sculpting water - Changing dev culture at build time and commit time.  

Software development needs good process and fails under stupid process.  A good process disappears from your daily life (tabs vs. spaces)

Good process recognizes the difference between process and culture.  Process is for things that never change like tabs vs. spaces and are easy to measure like no empty catch blocks.  Bad process tries to control things you might change your mind about like what makes good code documentation or things that are hard to measure like code reviews.

Commandments of localization:

1. Resource all strings
2. Never concatenate strings
3. Put all punctuation in the resourced string
4. Never hard-code date, time, or currency formats
5. Never concatenate names
6. Use UTF-8 99.9999 percent of the time
7. Use dynamic layouts
8. Always use a full locale
9. Never trust the browser to know the right locale

Strongly vs. weakly typed languages and why they matter

        In the beginning there was C
        Object oriented and strongly typed languages
        C++ and Objective C
        Java
        Ruby, PHP, JavaScript and other duck typed languages
        Which way is better?
