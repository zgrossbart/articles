Good business software gets out of your way and lets you get your work done.  Great games get in your way and distract you for hours.

Games challenge you with new interfaces that make you think.  Innovative interactions make games exciting, but they're always teaching you new mechanisms and helping you through interactions you're unfamiliar with.  Here are six interface teaching techniques from popular iPad games.

<h3>Tell stories visually</h3>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinarium">Machinarium</a> follows a little silver robot as he solves puzzles, rescues his girlfriend and saves a city from a bomb.  This game solves sets of puzzles to help the robot on his adventure.  The puzzles get more challenging as the game progresses.

Each screen introduces new rules, but the Czech Machinarium development team gives all the instructions visually instead of using text.  The visual stories explain the rules simply and don't require translation.

<blockquote>
    Find the pins that fit into my saxophone.
</blockquote>

Each member of the robot band needs a different part for their instrument.  The saxophone needs pins, the drummer needs a drum and there's a strange creature with glowing red eyes stuck in the didgeridoo.  The game designers could have filled paragraphs explaining these predicaments, but they just show you instead.  A simple graphic makes it clear exactly what you need.

Machinarium extends their visual explainations to more complex puzzles like the water tank fountain.

    <!--machinarium.jpg -->
    
<blockquote>
    Find the red wrenches to close and open the right valves and stop the water flowing into the tank on the level above you and drain the water that's already in the tank out of it.
</blockquote>

My sentence trips over itself with all the details, but the robot wrench describes the entire puzzle with a simple visual thought.  

<h3>Make undo easy</h3>

Complex support structures and an array of goo balls fill <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_goo">World of Goo</a> with a challenging set of puzzles.  Each level contains a fixed set of goo ball building blocks, a challenge to overcome like a chasm, spikes, or fire and a pipe the goo balls escape through.  

Each move adds a new goo ball to the structure by forming connections with existing goo balls.  Avoid the obstacles and reach the pipe with the smallest number of goo balls to beat the level.

    <!--world_of_goo.jpg -->
    
Each goo ball you add changes the existing goo structure in ways that are often difficult to predict.  One errant ball is enough to tip over a tower or plunge you into flames.

World of Goo provides a simple mechanism to undo your moves when disaster strikes your goo.  Instead of fiddling with an undo menu or making a special hidden gesture they provide fireflys which buzz around your goo structure.

    <!--world_of_goo_firefly.jpg -->
    
Each firefly provide a single undo.  They're present and easy to tap on without distracting you from the level.  Providing an easy undo mechanism takes the fear out of making tough moves and makes you better at the game.

<h3>Guide users through new interactions</h3>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_lessmore">The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore</a> uses the landscape of New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina to tell the story of a quiet man who travels to live in a world of anthropamorphic books.  The game works like a childrens book with each page providing a new interaction or puzzle.

The developers added simple indicators to help you understand each page.

    <!-- morris.jpg -->
    
The first page opens with a simple swipe gesture to start the wind and blow away Morris's books.  The arrows show you how to get the storm going.

    <!-- morris_house.jpg -->
    
A few pages later the storm picks Morris's house off the ground and the swipe moves in a circle to spin his house in the wind.

The interactions gain subtlety as the book moves on.  

    <!-- humpty_dumpty.jpg -->
    
The color palette slowly changes from black and white to color with the brighter elements drawing your attention and inviting you to interact with them.

<h3>Incorporate Visual menus</h3>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmos">Osmos</a> combines complex Newtonian physics simulations into a simple to understand puzzle game.  You're a dust mote who expels mass to move.  Tap the screen and the mote shoots mass in the direction of your finger.

The mote navigates a field full of complex forces trying to consume smaller motes and avoid the larger ones.  The other motes have different properties like antimatter, orbits and repulsor gravity.

Arcade mode starts by choosing the type of game you want.

    <!--osmos_menu.jpg -->

<blockquote>
    Choose your game type from Ambient, Antimatter, Impasse, Repulsor, Sentient, Solar, Warped Chaos and Epicycles
</blockquote>

The dizzying array of options presents a complex navigation issue when choosing which game to play.  They could have represented each item with words, but Warped Chaos and Epicycles (the names of the last two levels) don't mean much on their own.  The pictures maka eit clear how each game works:  Warped Chaos moves between larger motes with high gravity and Epicycles spirals around them.

The pictures give each name meaning and the colors provide visual distinctions to make the levels more memorable.

Morris Lessmore uses the same technique for the table of contents of their book.

    <!--morris_toc.jpg-->
    
Instead of a menu with 27 options they show you a preview of each page with small indicators in the upper-right like a puzzle piece or a plane to give you a hint about each page.

<h3>Don't make people wait</h3>

Osmos, like World of Goo, rewards efficiency.  You must expel mass to move, but your mote gets smaller with each tap.  Omos advises, "Relax.  The wise player taps less often."

Fewer taps win the level, but they make the mote move more slowly.  Complex levels require a glacial pace.  Omose makes the game more enjoyable with a time control.  

    <!--osmos_time_fast.jpg -->
    
Swiping to the right anywhere on the screen moves the time control on the bottom into the blue and speeds up the game.

    <!--osmos_time_slow.jpg -->
    
Swiping to the left move the time control to the red and slows down the game so you can focus on tricky manuevers.  

Without the time control Osmos would incent you to play poorly so the game moves faster.  With it you can focus on the game play and still have a fun fast experience.

<h3>Provide simple tutorials</h3>

<a href="http://www.spelltower.com/">SpellTower</a> combines <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle">Boggle</a> to create a unique word game.  The game leverages the iPad touch interface and moves fast.  

Instead of starting out with a blank screen or an introduction document they walk you through a real game with a simple tutorial.

    <!--spell_tower.png -->
    
The tutorial level takes only a few minutes and teaches you all the rules you need to get started.  Machinarium gets you started with a visual robot instruction manual.

    <!-- machinarium_start.jpg -->

Tutorial levels are ubiquitous in games ranging from simple puzzles to comples <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">first-person shooter</a> games, but is missing from business software.  Many business programs provide tutorials showing you how to perform specific tasks, but they don't walk you through a real project.  

Imagine if Microsoft Word started you off by walking you through creating a resume or Facebook challenged you to find your first dozen friends.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">Gamification</a> is a popular philosophy in social media user interface design, but getting you started fast goes beyond badges and achievements.  

Simple tutorials get you up and running fast and let you start playing as soon as possible.

What are your favorite ideas to steal from games?  How have you applied them in other software?
