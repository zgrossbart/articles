Good business and personal software get out of your way and let you get your work done.  Good games get in your way and distract you for hours.

Games constantly challenge you with new interfaces that make you think and learn how to use new mechanisms.  These innovative interactions aren't just for games.  This article looks at six interaction design ideas from iPad games you should steal for your software projects.

<h3>Tell stories visually</h3>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinarium">Machinarium</a> follows a little silver robot as he solves puzzles, rescues his girlfriend and saves a city.  This point and click game asks you to solve sets of puzzles to help the robot along his adventure.  The puzzles get more challenging as the game progresses.

Each puzzle requires a deep understanding of the rules, but the Czech Machinarium development team gives all the instructions visually instead of using text.

<blockquote>
    Find the pins that fit into my saxophone.
</blockquote>

Each member of the robot band needs a different part for their instruments.  The saxophone needs pins, the drummer needs a drum and there's a strange creature with glowing red eyes stuck in the didgeridoo.  The game designers could have filled paragraphs explaining these predicaments, but they just show you instead.  A simple graphic makes it clear exactly what you need.

Machinarium extends their visual explainations to more complex puzzles like the water tank fountain.

    <!--machinarium.jpg -->
    
<blockquote>
    Find the red wrenches and close and open the valves to stop the water flowing into the tank on the level above you and drain the water out of the tank.
</blockquote>

The robot wrench describes the entire puzzle with a simple visual thought when she tells the robot how to get through the water tank fountain.  

Simple visual story telling saves paragraphs of documentation and makes interfaces easy to undersand.

<h3>Make it easy to undo</h3>

Complex support structures and an array of goo balls fill <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_goo">World of Goo</a> with a challenging set of puzzles.  Each level contains a set of goo ball building blocks, a challenge to overcome like a chasm, spikes, or fire and a pipe the goo balls escape too.  

Each moves adds a goo ball to the structure by forming connections to existing goo balls.  Avoid the obstacles and build to the pipe the most efficient way possible to solve the puzzle and beat the level.

    <!--world_of_goo.jpg -->
    
Each goo ball you add changes the existing goo structure in ways that are sometimes difficult to predict.  One errant ball is enough to tip over a tower or plunge you into flame.

World of Goo provides a simple mechanism to undo your moves.  Instead of interacting with an undo menu or making a special hidden gesture they provide fireflys which buzz around your goo structure.

    <!--world_of_goo_firefly.jpg -->
    
Each firefly provide a single undo.  They're present and easy to click on without being distracting.  Providing an easy undo mechanism takes the fear out of making tough moves and makes you better at the game.

<h3>Guide users through new interactions</h3>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_lessmore">The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore</a> uses the landscape of New Orleans and Hurricane Katrina to tell the story of a quiet man who travels to live in a world of anthropamorphic books.  Each page provides a new interaction or puzzle.

Turning each page of Morris Lessmore provides a new interface full of novel interactions.  The developers add simple indicators to help you understand each page.

    <!-- morris.jpg -->
    
The first page starts with a simple swipe gesture to start the wind and blow away Morris's books.  The arrows show you how to get the storm started.

    <!-- morris_house.jpg -->
    
A few pages later the storm picks Morris's house off the group and the swipe moves in a circle to spin the house in the wind.

As the book moves on the interactions gain subtlety and no longer need pointers.

The color palette slowly changes from black and white to color with the brighter elements drawing your attention and inviting you to interact with them.

<h3>Visual menus</h3>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmos">Osmos</a> combines complex Newtonian physics simulations into a simple to understand puzzle game.  You're a dust mote who expels mass to move.  Tap the screen and the mote shoots mass in the direction of your finger.

The mote navigates a field full of complex forces trying to consume smaller motes and avoid the larger ones.  The other motes have different properties like antimatter, orbits and repulsor gravity.

Arcade mode starts by choosing the type of game you want.

    <!--osmos_menu.jpg -->

<blockquote>
    Choose your game type from Ambient, Antimatter, Impasse, Repulsor, Sentient, Solar, Warped Chaos and Epicycles
</blockquote>

The dizzying array of options presents a complex navigation issue when choosing which game to play.  They could have represented each item with words, but Warped Chaos and Epicycles (the names of the last two levels) don't mean much on their own.  The pictures maka eit clear how each game works:  Warped Chaos moves between larger motes with high gravity and Epicycles spirals around them.

The pictures give each name meaning and the colors provide visual distinctions to make the levels more memorable.

<h3>Don't make people wait</h3>

Osmos, like World of Goo, rewards efficiency.  You must expel mass to move, but your mote gets smaller with each tap.  Omos advises, "Relax.  The wise player taps less often."

Fewer taps win the level, but they make the mote move more slowly.  Complex levels require a glacial pace.  Omose makes the game more enjoyable with a time control.  

    <!--osmos_time_fast.jpg -->
    
Swiping to the right anywhere on the screen moves the time control on the bottom into the blue and speeds up the game.

    <!--osmos_time_slow.jpg -->
    
Swiping to the left move the time control to the red and slows down the game so you can focus on tricky manuevers.  

Without the time control Osmos would incent you to play poorly so the game moves faster.  With it you can focus on the game play and still have a fun fast experience.

<h3>Provide simple tutorials</h3>

<a href="http://www.spelltower.com/">SpellTower</a> combines <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle">Boggle</a> to create a unique word game.  The game leverages the iPad touch interface and moves fast.  

Instead of starting out with a blank screen or an introduction document they walk you through a real game with a simple tutorial.

    <!--spell_tower.png -->
    
The tutorial level takes only a few minutes and teaches you all the rules you need to get started. 

Tutorial levels are ubiquitous in games ranging from simple puzzles to comples <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">first-person shooter</a> games, but is missing from business software.  Many business programs provide tutorials showing you how to perform specific tasks, but they don't walk you through a real project.  

Imagine if Microsoft Word started you off by walking you through creating a resume or Facebook challenged you to find your first dozen friends.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">Gamification</a> is a popular philosophy in social media user interface design, but getting you started fast goes beyond badges and achievements.  

Simple tutorials get you up and running fast and let you start playing as soon as possible.
