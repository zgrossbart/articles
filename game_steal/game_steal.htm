<h3>Tell stories visually</h3>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinarium">Machinarium</a> follows a little silver robot as he solves puzzles, rescues his girlfriend and saves a city.  This point and click game asks you to solve sets of puzzles to help the robot along his adventure.  The puzzles get more challenging as the game progresses.

Each puzzle requires a deep understanding of the rules, but the Czech Machinarium development team gives all the instructions visually instead of using text.

<blockquote>
    Find the pins that fit into my saxophone.
</blockquote>

Each member of the robot band needs a different part for their instruments.  The saxophone needs pins, the drummer needs a drum and there's a strange creature with glowing red eyes stuck in the didgeridoo.  The game designers could have filled paragraphs explaining these predicaments, but they just show you instead.  A simple graphic makes it clear exactly what you need.

Machinarium extends their visual explainations to more complex puzzles like the water tank fountain.

    <!--machinarium.jpg -->
    
<blockquote>
    Find the red wrenches and close and open the valves to stop the water flowing into the tank on the level above you and drain the water out of the tank.
</blockquote>

The robot wrench describes the entire puzzle with a simple visual thought when she tells the robot how to get through the water tank fountain.  

Simple visual story telling saves paragraphs of documentation and makes interfaces easy to undersand.

<h3>Visual menus</h3>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmos">Osmos</a> combines complex Newtonian physics simulations into a simple to understand puzzle game.  You're a dust mote who expels mass to move.  You navigate a field full of complex forces trying to consume smaller motes and avoid the larger ones.  The other motes have different properties like antimatter, orbits and repulsor gravity.

Arcade mode starts by choosing the type of game you want.

    <!--osmos_menu.jpg -->

<blockquote>
    Choose your game type from Ambient, Antimatter, Impasse, Repulsor, Sentient, Solar, Warped Chaos and Epicycles
</blockquote>

The dizzying array of options presents a complex navigation issue when choosing which game to play.  They could have represented each item with words, but Warped Chaos and Epicycles (the names of the last two levels) don't mean much on their own.  The pictures maka eit clear how each game works:  Warped Chaos moves between larger motes with high gravity and Epicycles spirals around them.

The pictures give each name meaning and the colors provide visual distinctions to make the levels more memorable.

<h3>Make it easy to undo</h3>

Complex support structures and an array of goo balls fill <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_goo">World of Goo</a> with a challenging set of puzzles.  Each level contains a set of goo ball building blocks, a challenge to overcome like a chasm, spikes, or fire and a pipe the goo balls escape too.  

Each moves adds a goo ball to the structure by forming connections to existing goo balls.  Avoid the obstacles and build to the pipe the most efficient way possible to solve the puzzle and beat the level.

    <!--world_of_goo.jpg -->
    
Each goo ball you add changes the existing goo structure in ways that are sometimes difficult to predict.  One errant ball is enough to tip over a tower or plunge you into flame.

World of Goo provides a simple mechanism to undo your moves.  Instead of interacting with an undo menu or making a special hidden gesture they provide fireflys which buzz around your goo structure.

    <!--world_of_goo_firefly.jpg -->
    
Each firefly provide a single undo.  They're present and easy to click on without being distracting.  Providing an easy undo mechanism takes the fear out of making tough moves and makes you better at the game.
